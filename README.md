# web-app

A simple JavaScript based todo app project with signup and authentication functionality. The project was built to test my current skills
in both back and frontend development.

Backend:
- Database built with PostgreSQL
- Server side built with Deno

Frontend:
- Frontend build with Svelte
- Styling done with DaisyUI component styles

App can be containerized with Docker
